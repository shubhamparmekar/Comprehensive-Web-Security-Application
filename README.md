## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) installed on your local machine.
- Basic knowledge of PHP and MySQL.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/comprehensive-web-security-application.git
    ```

2. **Move the Project to XAMPP's `htdocs` Directory**

    Copy the cloned project folder to the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation. Typically, this can be found at:
    - Windows: `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
    - macOS: `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/`
    - Linux: `/opt/lampp/htdocs/`

3. **Start XAMPP**

    Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL modules.

4. **Create the Database**

    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    - Create a new database, for example, `web_security_db`.
    - Import the database schema. In phpMyAdmin, select the newly created database, go to the `Import` tab, and import the SQL file located in the project directory at `database/schema.sql`.

5. **Configure the Application**

    - Open the project directory and locate the `config.php` file.
    - Update the database configuration settings in `config.php` with your database name, username, and password.

    ```php
    define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
    define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
    define('DB_DATABASE', 'web_security_db');
    ```

## Usage

1. **Access the Application**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/<folder-name>/index.php`.

2. **Register and Login**

    - Log in with your newly created credentials.

3. **Explore the Features**

    - Test various security features implemented in the application.
    - Experiment with user roles and access control.
    - Monitor logs and activity.
